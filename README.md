## Yet another python WSGI micro-framework

Following [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/) and [Bottle](https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/) footsteps, adding a bit of italian flavor :-)

This is a work in progress at a very initial stage, so it won't be available to install through Python official repository ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/)) for a while.

So, as of now, only available means of installing/using it is through git clone, or just raw downloading bicchiere.py as Bicchiere follows the footsteps of Bottle.py in the sense of being a single file framework.
